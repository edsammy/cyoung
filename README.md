The MotionPlayer interfaces with VLC media player and skips to a new video when a new person enters the field of view of the webcam. This project was written using Processing and utilizes the [OpenCV processing library](https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing) developed by Ben Borenstein (thank you!) 

Use the following command to install:
```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edsammy/cyoung/master/setup.sh | bash
```
This will setup the file system, install VLC media player, move it into the Applications directory, and apply the correct settings to use the Motion Video Player.
